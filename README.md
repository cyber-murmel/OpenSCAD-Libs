## Downloading
In OpenSCAD click `File > Show Library Folerâ€¦` to get your library directory.
In my case this is `~/.local/share/OpenSCAD/libraries`.

Open a c
```bash
cd ~/.local/share/OpenSCAD/libraries
git init
git remote add upstream https://github.com/cyber-murmel/OpenSCAD-Libs.git
git pull upstream master
```
